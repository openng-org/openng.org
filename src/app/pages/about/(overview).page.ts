        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our mission</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          OpenNG is a global organization dedicated to helping the Angular
          open-source ecosystem thrive. We focus on the maintenance effort,
          reviving abandoned projects, connecting them with maintainers, and
          supporting the wider community when help is needed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What we are not</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          We are not here to take over every library by forking it, and we do
          not act as if we know better than existing maintainers. We step in
          when maintenance has stalled and the community still depends on a
          project, not to replace healthy, active open source.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Why we exist</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Many open-source projects do not fail because the idea was bad. They
          fail because maintaining them is a lonely journey, and finding a
          successor is incredibly difficult.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          The disappearance of the ngneat organization from GitHub was the
          trigger for OpenNG, an idea that had been forming for a while. When
          widely used libraries vanish overnight, the whole Angular community
          feels the impact.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How we work</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          OpenNG acts as a community hub rather than a single-person
          organization. That approach makes it easier to find sponsors, share
          governance responsibilities, and direct support where it is needed
          most, whether that is reviving a project, funding a bounty, or
          connecting a library with new contributors.
