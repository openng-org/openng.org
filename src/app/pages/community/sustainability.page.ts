        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">The maintenance problem</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Open-source projects often fail not because the code is bad, but
          because maintenance is a lonely journey. When one person burns out or
          disappears, entire ecosystems lose critical tooling overnight.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          OpenNG was created after the ngneat organization vanished from GitHub,
          leaving a cross-section of widely used libraries without a clear path
          forward. Sustainability is our answer to that pattern.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Community hub model</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Instead of relying on a single maintainer, OpenNG distributes
          ownership across a group of Angular community members. Acting as a
          community hub rather than an individual organization makes it easier
          to find sponsors and to distribute resources where they are needed
          most.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Finding maintainers</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Sustainability starts with people. Our main focus is reviving abandoned
          projects and connecting them with maintainers, whether experienced
          contributors or newcomers ready to step up. See our
          <a class="link link-primary" routerLink="/about/governance">
            governance page
          </a>
          for how we approach maintainer onboarding.

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Sponsorship and bounties</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          At some point, we plan to seek sponsors to help with governance costs
          and to create bounties that fund maintenance work. As a community
          organization, we aim to put that support where it matters most,
          whether that is a security fix, an Angular version upgrade, or
          onboarding a new maintainer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Sponsorship programs are not live yet. If you are interested in
          supporting OpenNG, visit our

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Keeping projects current</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Sustainability means more than keeping the lights on. Revived projects
          receive updates for current Angular versions, refreshed dependencies,
          and documented upgrade paths so teams are not stranded on unsupported
          releases.
