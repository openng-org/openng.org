        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Why we are selective</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-7">
          OpenNG does not fork every unmaintained repository. We focus on
          libraries the community still depends on, where a realistic path to
          ongoing maintenance exists. These criteria help us decide which
          projects to pursue and how to approach their original maintainers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Eligibility criteria</h2>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-7">
          A project must meet all of the following before we consider onboarding
          it into the foundation:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground leading-7">
          <li class="mb-3">
            <span class="font-medium text-foreground"
              >Open-source license.</span
            >
            The project must be released under a recognized open-source license
            that allows community maintenance and continued distribution.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-3">
            <span class="font-medium text-foreground"
              >Abandoned or removed.</span
            >
            The repository has had no meaningful activity for at least one year,
            or the project has been deleted while the community still relies on
            it.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-3">
            <span class="font-medium text-foreground">Still useful.</span>
            The library addresses a real need that is not already covered by the
            Angular framework itself. Where migration is required, we may create
            schematics or guides to help teams adopt a revived version.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-3">
            <span class="font-medium text-foreground"
              >No active alternative.</span
            >
            There is no maintained replacement or active fork that already
            serves the same purpose for the ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-foreground"
              >Enterprise relevance.</span
            >
            The project must address a need in professional or enterprise
            Angular development. A hobby or niche community tool, such as a DnD
            projection-creation app, may be valuable to its users but falls
            outside OpenNG's scope.
          </li>

          Once a project matches these criteria, we begin outreach before any
