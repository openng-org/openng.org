        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Why we are selective</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          OpenNG does not fork every unmaintained repository. We focus on
          libraries the community still depends on, where a realistic path to
          ongoing maintenance exists. These criteria help us decide which
          projects to pursue and how to approach their original maintainers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Eligibility criteria</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          A project must meet all of the following before we consider
          onboarding it into the foundation:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-3 pl-6 text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-base-content">Open-source license.</span>
            The project must be released under a recognized open-source license
            that allows community maintenance and continued distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-base-content">Abandoned or removed.</span>
            The repository has had no meaningful activity for at least one
            year, or the project has been deleted while the community still
            relies on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-base-content">Still useful.</span>
            The library addresses a real need that is not already covered by
            the Angular framework itself. Where migration is required, we may
            create schematics or guides to help teams adopt a revived version.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-base-content">No active alternative.</span>
            There is no maintained replacement or active fork that already
            serves the same purpose for the ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-medium text-base-content">Enterprise relevance.</span>
            The project must address a need in professional or enterprise Angular
            development. A hobby or niche community tool, such as a DnD
            projection-creation app, may be valuable to its users but falls
            outside OpenNG's scope.

                For public repositories, we open a GitHub issue to explain
                our intent and ask for permission to revive the project under
                OpenNG. For private or deleted projects, we look for other
                ways to reach the original author or organization.

                We first contact previous active maintainers and contributors
                to propose joining the revived project. If they decline or are
                unavailable, we open maintainer positions to the wider
                community.
