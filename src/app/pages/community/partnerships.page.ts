        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Organizations that depend on Angular open source share a common
          interest: critical libraries should not vanish when maintainers move
          on. As a community hub rather than a single-person effort, OpenNG is
          positioned to attract sponsors and distribute support where it is
          needed most.

            <p class="text-base-content/70">
              Companies can sponsor governance costs, fund maintenance bounties,
              or provide engineering time for libraries their teams rely on
              every day.

              Meetups, conferences, and other Angular community groups can
              collaborate on outreach, contributor onboarding, and shared
              advocacy for sustainable open source.

          OpenNG is still early, and formal partnership and sponsorship
          programs are being defined alongside our governance model. We aim for
          clear expectations on contributions, recognition, and how partners
          participate in decisions that affect the projects we maintain.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-7">
          Whether you represent a company, a community group, or an existing
          open-source project, we welcome a conversation about how we can
          align on long-term maintenance goals.
