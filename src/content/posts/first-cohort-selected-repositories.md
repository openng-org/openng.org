description: OpenNG announces the first six ngneat libraries we will maintain, and how we chose them.

When the ngneat organization disappeared from GitHub, the Angular community lost more than one library. Teams across the ecosystem suddenly faced broken installs, unanswered issues, and no clear path forward for tools they had built on for years.

Since [introducing OpenNG](/blog/openng-foundation-announcement), we have been working through which projects to take on first. Today we are announcing the **first cohort** of repositories we will maintain:

- [ngneat/cashew](https://github.com/ngneat/cashew), HTTP caching for Angular applications
- [ngneat/spectator](https://github.com/ngneat/spectator), a testing library that simplifies Angular component tests
- [ngneat/query](https://github.com/ngneat/query), TanStack Query bindings for Angular
- [ngneat/falso](https://github.com/ngneat/falso), realistic fake data generation for tests and development
- [ngneat/elf](https://github.com/ngneat/elf), a reactive, immutable state management library
- [ngneat/until-destroy](https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy), automatic subscription cleanup for Angular components

These six libraries represent a cross-section of the former ngneat ecosystem, from testing and data fetching to state management and developer ergonomics. Each one still has a meaningful user base and a gap where ongoing maintenance stopped.

## How we selected them

We did not start with a list of every abandoned Angular repository on GitHub. Our intake process focuses on libraries where **maintenance has stalled** and the **community still depends on the project**, the same principles outlined in our [governance](/about/governance) and [standards](/community/standards) pages.

For this first cohort, the criteria were straightforward:

1. **Community impact**, libraries with broad adoption across the Angular ecosystem, not niche experiments
2. **Clear maintenance gap**, projects where issues piled up, releases stopped, and no successor was in sight after ngneat went offline
3. **A realistic path forward**, codebases we can assess, test, and bring back to a healthy state without fragmenting the ecosystem through unnecessary forks
4. **Shared origin**, all six come from the same former organization, which lets us coordinate maintenance, tooling, and release practices from day one

We also weighed practical factors: existing test coverage, CI setup, documentation quality, and how tightly each library couples to current Angular versions. Projects that met the bar on impact and need, but needed the most urgent attention, rose to the top.

This cohort is intentionally focused. We are not claiming every ngneat library at once, we are starting where the community need is clearest and where we can learn how to maintain projects well before expanding further.

## What happens next

Selecting a repository is only the first step. **Finding maintainers is the work that matters most.**

For each library in this cohort, we will closely look for people to carry day-to-day maintenance, reviewing pull requests, triaging issues, cutting releases, and keeping dependencies current. For established projects with large user bases, we expect to look for contributors with relevant experience, potentially recommended by trusted community members such as Angular GDEs. For smaller or less complex libraries, we are open to people coming forward on their own, that is how many of us started as maintainers in the first place.

In the coming weeks, we will:

- Assess the current state of each repository, tests, CI, open issues, and Angular version compatibility
- Publish per-project contribution guides as repositories come under active maintenance
- Open GitHub Discussions for coordination and maintainer interest
- Share progress on the [projects page](/projects) as work moves forward

If you have experience with any of these libraries, or want to learn by contributing, we want to hear from you. Read our [get involved](/community/get-involved) page and [governance overview](/about/governance) to understand how we onboard maintainers and share maintenance.

## Looking ahead

This cohort is a starting point, not a finish line. Once these projects are on stable footing, we will keep evaluating other abandoned Angular libraries that meet our intake criteria. If you know a project the community relies on that has lost its maintainers, [get in touch](/about/contact).

The goal remains the same: critical Angular tooling should not vanish when the people behind it move on. With this first cohort, we are putting that principle into practice.
